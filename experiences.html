                    <p><strong>Context:</strong> I'm an Instructional Aide for ENGR 101, Introduction to Computers and Programming, a freshman engineering course at the University of Michigan. I provide instructional support in MATLAB and C++ through office hours, helping students with homework, labs, and projects. My role is to help them debug code, explain concepts in ways that click, and guide them through the frustration of getting something wrong before they figure it out.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Engineering Competency Connections:</strong></p>
                    
                    <h4>Communication</h4>
                    <p>Explaining technical concepts to beginners forced me to think about how I communicate. Students come in stuck on different things. Some need the big picture first. Others want to trace through their code line by line. I had to learn to read where someone was at and adapt how I explained things. That meant dropping jargon, drawing things out, and sometimes breaking a problem into even smaller pieces than I thought was possible. Clear communication in engineering matters whether you're in a design review, writing documentation, or walking a client through a solution.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
                    <p>When a student's MATLAB or C++ code isn't working, whether it's a homework problem, lab, or project, we debug together. I don't just give them the answer. We go through it. What did they expect? What's actually happening? What have they already tried? A lot of the time the bug is something simple, but the process of walking through it teaches them how to approach problems on their own. I also run into cases where I'm not sure what's wrong either. Then it's about thinking through it systematically, testing hypotheses, and knowing when to look things up or ask someone else. That's the same kind of problem solving I use in my own projects.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Technical Competence</h4>
                    <p>To help students in MATLAB and C++, I need to understand the material deeply. That means staying on top of the coursework, remembering syntax and how the tools work, and being able to apply concepts across different types of problems. Sometimes a question about arrays, loops, or functions pushes me to dig into something I hadn't thought about in a while. Being an IA keeps my programming fundamentals sharp and forces me to connect different ideas in ways that help students see the full picture.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Leadership</h4>
                    <p>Even though I'm not the professor, I'm in a position where students look to me for guidance. That means setting a tone in office hours that's supportive but still pushes them to think. It means knowing when to let them struggle a bit and when to step in. It also means being reliable. If I say I'll be there, I'm there. If I say I'll follow up on something, I do. Small things, but they matter when you're trying to help people learn and grow.</p>
                    
                    <p>Being an IA has made me a better communicator, a more patient problem solver, and more confident in my own technical skills. It's also reminded me how much it matters to have someone who can explain things when you're stuck. That's something I want to carry into whatever I do next.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> I learned to delegate, trust department heads, and focus on what only I could handle instead of micromanaging.</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> I established regular check-ins and a shared doc so everyone stayed aligned and conflicts were avoided.</li>
                            <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> I brought together a team of department heads and let them own their work while I coordinated the big picture.</li>

                        <p>I went from trying to control every detail to trusting my team and working backwards from the event date. The outcome: a successful event and a lasting lesson in what real leadership looks like.</p>
