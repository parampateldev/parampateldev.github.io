                        <p>I've never been great with heights. The thought of standing on top of a mountain and looking down used to genuinely freak me out. So when my friends invited me on a skiing trip, I almost said no. But I figured if I was ever going to get over this fear, this was my shot.</p>
                        <p>Standing at the top of that first slope was terrifying. My legs were shaking and I was questioning every decision that led me there. But then I looked over and saw my friends hyping me up, laughing, just having the best time. So I just went for it. Once I started moving, something shifted. I wasn't thinking about the height anymore. I was just focused on not falling and feeling the wind and actually enjoying it.</p>
                        <p>By the end of the day we were racing each other down the mountain. That fear I'd had for years was just gone. Replaced by this feeling of actually being alive and free. Sometimes you just have to do the thing that scares you because that's where the best stuff happens.</p>

                        <p>Walking into the arena that night nobody expected the Pistons to win. The Celtics were on fire that season and we were not. To make it even better, I was sitting next to one of my best friends who's a massive Celtics fan. The trash talk started in the parking lot.</p>
                        <p>Every time the Celtics scored he'd turn to me with this huge grin. I was trying so hard to stay optimistic but it wasn't looking good. Then something shifted. The Pistons started playing like they actually believed they could win. The crowd got louder. The energy in that arena was insane.</p>
                        <p>When the buzzer went off and we'd actually won, the whole place went crazy. My friend just sat there in shock while I was losing my mind. That night reminded me that sometimes the best moments come when nobody expects them. And yeah, I definitely held those bragging rights over him for weeks.</p>

                        <p>Cedar Point calls itself the Roller Coaster Capital of the World and after going I'm not going to argue with that. But what made the trip so memorable wasn't just the rides. It was going with my closest friends and experiencing all of it together, sharing every scream and laugh and moment of pure adrenaline.</p>
                        <p>My favorite ride was definitely Top Thrill 2. You go from 0 to 120 mph in like 4 seconds, shoot straight up 420 feet, and then drop back down. That split second at the top where you can see the entire park and Lake Erie is terrifying and incredible at the same time.</p>
                        <p>We spent the whole day going from ride to ride, trying to see who could handle the most intense coasters without freaking out. Spoiler: we all freaked out. By the time we left we were completely exhausted, definitely sunburned, but just really happy. Days like that remind me that sometimes you need to step away from the serious stuff and just have fun.</p>
