                        I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science, and I'm really drawn to where finance 
                        meets technology. I want to work in global fintech or quant finance eventually because 
                        I think there's something powerful about using tech to solve problems that affect 
                        people across the world.

                        Outside of school, I spend a lot of time with my community through BAPS, where I've 
                        learned what it actually means to lead and serve others. When I'm not in class or 
                        working on projects, I'm probably at the gym, playing basketball or pickleball with 
                        friends, grinding ranked in Valorant or FIFA, or trying to find the best food spots 
                        around.

                            BAPS has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It's more than just a place 
                            I go on weekends. It's where I've grown up, where I've learned what it means to actually 
                            serve others, and where I've made some of my closest friends. As a Youth Activities Leader, 
                            I get to organize events that bring our community together, and honestly, seeing hundreds 
                            of families show up and connect with each other never gets old.

                            When they asked me to lead the Kids Diwali Celebration, I said yes immediately. Then it 
                            hit me what I'd actually signed up for. This wasn't just throwing together a small event. 
                            We were expecting over 500 people, mostly families with kids, and I was responsible for 
                            making sure everything came together. Decorations, stage program, gifts for the tables, 
                            registration, flow management... the list kept growing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I remember sitting at my desk looking at all the moving pieces and thinking, "How am I 
                            supposed to manage all of this?" I'd never done anything close to this scale before, 
                            and suddenly I had all these people counting on me to not mess it up.

                            My first instinct was to get involved in everything. I wanted to know what color 
                            tablecloths we were using, what songs the kids were performing, what gifts we were 
                            putting on each table. I thought that's what a good leader did. Stay on top of every 
                            detail, be part of every decision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What I didn't realize was that I was basically doing everyone else's jobs for them. 
                            I had recruited these amazing department heads who actually knew what they were doing, 
                            but instead of trusting them, I was hovering over every choice they made. It was 
                            exhausting for me and probably pretty annoying for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Two weeks before the event, everything came to a head. I was falling behind on the big 
                            picture stuff because I was too busy micromanaging the small stuff. Department heads were 
                            asking me for approval on things they could've easily decided themselves. The whole team 
                            could feel the stress, and I knew something had to change.
                        </p>

                            So I had to completely rethink what I was doing. Being a leader didn't mean being 
                            involved in every single thing. It meant trusting the people I'd brought on board to 
                            do their thing while I focused on the stuff only I could handle. Here's what actually 
                            worked:
                        </p>

                                <h4>Actually Trusting People</h4>
                                <p>
                                    I had to learn to actually trust my department heads. Not just say I trusted them, 
                                    but really let them do their jobs. I told them what we needed to accomplish and 
                                    then stepped back. Instead of sitting in on every meeting, I set up weekly check-ins 
                                    where they'd update me and let me know if they were stuck on anything. It freed up 
                                    so much of my time, and they finally felt like they owned their work.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>Figuring Out What Actually Mattered</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Not everything needed my attention. Some things were actually important, like making 
                                    sure departments weren't planning things that would conflict with each other, keeping 
                                    track of the budget, and handling safety requirements. Other things, like what color 
                                    the tablecloths should be? That's what I had a decorations team for.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <div class="learning-item">
                                <h4>Working Backwards</h4>
                                <p>
                                    I started working backwards from the event date, mapping out when things actually 
                                    needed to be done. This helped me see where departments depended on each other. 
                                    Like, the stage program team couldn't finalize their setup until decorations figured 
                                    out the venue layout. Once I could see these connections, I could focus on making 
                                    sure things stayed on track instead of getting lost in daily details.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>Keeping Everyone in the Loop</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Instead of random messages and conversations all over the place, I set up regular 
                                    times for updates. I also made a shared doc where department heads could see what 
                                    everyone else was working on. It cut down on people asking the same questions over 
                                    and over, and it helped everyone see how their piece fit into the whole event.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                        <p>
                            The event itself went really well. Over 500 people showed up, the kids had an amazing 
                            time, and every department came through. But honestly, the numbers aren't what stuck 
                            with me from this whole experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I learned that being a leader doesn't mean you have to be the smartest person in the 
                            room or have all the answers. It's about finding good people, trusting them to do 
                            their thing, and knowing when to get involved versus when to let them handle it. You 
                            need to see the big picture, but you don't need to obsess over every tiny detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This whole thing changed how I work with people now. Whether it's a group project for 
                            one of my CS classes or anything else, I think about what I learned here. Sometimes the 
                            best thing I can do isn't to jump in and do something myself. It's to find someone who's 
                            actually better at it than me and trust them to handle it.

                            BAPS keeps teaching me things. Not just about leadership, but about who I am and 
                            who I want to be. Every event, every time something doesn't go as planned, I learn 
                            something new. KDC taught me that leadership isn't something you just figure out 
                            once. You have to keep working at it, keep adjusting. And sometimes the biggest 
                            growth comes from admitting you're struggling and being willing to try a different 
                            approach.

                            When I think about what I want to do after graduation, working in fintech or quant, 
                            I know the technical stuff is just part of it. Being able to work with people, 
                            delegate effectively, figure out what actually matters... these are the things that 
                            will actually let me do something meaningful, whether I'm building systems for 
                            global markets or just working with a team on something important.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Those kids deserved an incredible Diwali celebration, and we gave them one. But 
                            what I got out of it was just as valuable. I know now that I can step up when 
                            something matters, that I can actually lead when I need to, and that I still have 
                            a lot to learn along the way.

                        <p>
                            I've never been great with heights. Like, the thought of standing on top of a mountain 
                            and looking down used to genuinely freak me out. So when my friends invited me on a 
                            skiing trip, I almost said no. But I figured if I was ever going to get over this fear, 
                            this was my shot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Standing at the top of that first slope was terrifying. My legs were shaking, and I was 
                            questioning every decision that led me there. But then I looked over and saw my friends 
                            hyping me up, laughing, just having the best time. So I just went for it. And once I 
                            started moving, something shifted. I wasn't thinking about the height anymore. I was just 
                            focused on not falling and feeling the wind and actually enjoying it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the end of the day, we were racing each other down the mountain. That fear I'd had 
                            for years? It was just gone. Replaced by this feeling of actually being alive and free. 
                            Sometimes you just have to do the thing that scares you, because that's where the best 
                            stuff happens.

                        <p>
                            Walking into the arena that night, nobody expected the Pistons to win. The Celtics were 
                            on fire that season, and we were... not. To make it even better, I was sitting next to 
                            one of my best friends who's a massive Celtics fan. The trash talk started in the parking 
                            lot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every time the Celtics scored, he'd turn to me with this huge grin. I was trying so hard 
                            to stay optimistic, but it wasn't looking good. Then something shifted. The Pistons started 
                            playing like they actually believed they could win. The crowd got louder. The energy in 
                            that arena was insane.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the buzzer went off and we'd actually won, the whole place went crazy. My friend just 
                            sat there in shock while I was losing my mind. That night reminded me that sometimes the 
                            best moments come when nobody expects them. And yeah, I definitely held those bragging 
                            rights over him for weeks.

                            Cedar Point calls itself the "Roller Coaster Capital of the World," and after going, 
                            I'm not going to argue with that. But what made the trip so memorable wasn't just the 
                            rides. It was going with my closest friends and experiencing all of it together, sharing 
                            every scream and laugh and moment of pure adrenaline.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My favorite ride was definitely Top Thrill 2. You go from 0 to 120 mph in like 4 seconds, 
                            shoot straight up 420 feet, and then drop back down. That split second at the top where 
                            you can see the entire park and Lake Erie? It's terrifying and incredible at the same time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We spent the whole day going from ride to ride, trying to see who could handle the most 
                            intense coasters without freaking out. Spoiler: we all freaked out. By the time we left, 
                            we were completely exhausted, definitely sunburned, but just really happy. Days like that 
                            remind me that sometimes you need to step away from the serious stuff and just have fun.
